# HW 5 - Node.js and MongoDB (USING OLD SPEC)
Built an Express.js server + MongoDB database that allows the users to store or delete any "Astronomy picture of the day" from NASA and view all their favorite ones in a list format.  
**Note: All of the routes are implemented in server/routes.js instead of server/index.js**
